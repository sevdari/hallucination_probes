# Multitoken Hallucination Probes for Apertus

This is the codebase for the project on multitoken hallucination prediction with probes for the Apertus LLM. The project is done as a part of Large Scale AI Engineering course at ETHZ by Klejdi Sevdari, Michal Korniak and Tymoteusz Kwiecinski and supervised by Anna Hedström and Imanol Schlag.


In the `./clariden/` directory there are some files and scripts that help with working on the cluster.

Readme of the original repository can be found [here](README.old.md).


## Setup
We moved from `uv` to simple `pip` setup because of problems with torch cuda dependencies.
Maybe it will be good to switch back to uv, but I found out this setup to be working just fine.

## TODO
current list of things todo is [here](./TODO.md).
