# Multitoken Hallucination Probes for Apertus

This is the codebase for the project on multitoken hallucination prediction with probes for the Apertus LLM. The project is done as a part of Large Scale AI Engineering course at ETHZ by Klejdi Sevdari, Michal Korniak and Tymoteusz Kwiecinski and supervised by Anna Hedström and Imanol Schlag.


In the `./clariden/` directory there are some files and scripts that help with working on the cluster.
