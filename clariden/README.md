## some config files


there are some config files related to the clariden cluster, e.g. [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) of the image, should be some sbatch scripts etc.


The base `.sqsh` image with main branch cloned is saved at `/capstor/scratch/cscs/tkwiecinski/hallucination-probes/base.sqsh`. It might not have the latest repo version though. 


Notice, that there is no uv env installed in the container, there is just a global env, so don't run `uv sync`
